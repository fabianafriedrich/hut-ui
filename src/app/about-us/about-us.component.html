      <h3>About HUT</h3>
      <p class="info">HUT is an online platform created by third year students at CCT College Dublin as the Final Project for the
        Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. The initial idea for the project came up during a meeting in a
        Caf√© where we were all debating what would be the project theme and final product. During the first group
        meetings in college, our group came up with several good ideas but what would benefit us all, as students,
        would be something related to Online Learning because during our last academic year, a global pandemic begins
        leaving Educational institutions with no option but adhere to online learning tools.</p>

      <h3 class="team">About Our Team</h3>
      <p class="info">
        We at HUT are students from CCT college the institution responsible for our high quality education which
        leaded us upon idealization of this amazing web application. As students we developed a web site responsible
        to attend students on their needs from the basic to high level among the subjects implemented by the college.
        Passionate for technology, we all had a opportunity to bring from each one of us our best tools to work hard
        and end up with good results and prestige. Obviously, seeking for more opportunities and ideas to keep our
        working growing  and expanding.
